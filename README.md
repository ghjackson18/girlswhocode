Website, Women's Coding Day, LeWagon Berlin, Germany.

On October 5th 2019, I attended a coding bootcamp for women.
They taught me how to build my own landing page for my website using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS.
It was a bit of a baptism of fire for someone who has never learnt to code before, but I learnt a lot!
I had a lot of fun solving problems and customising my design, and met some amazing people. 

Thanks, LeWagon.
